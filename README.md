Destription
-----------

Many universities use our Advance Proxy to allow its students access to various online
databases.  This extension adds a button to Chrome which allows for a quick way
to reload the current page through your Advance Proxy system.

All it does is pass the URL to your library's Advance Proxy login URL.  For example:
    http://google.com/
would change to:
    http://www.proxy-server-dummy-link.com/cgi-bin/r.cgi?url=http://google.com/
